<p class="home-paragraph">
  Welcome to InzForge, a personal engineering lab and component registry dedicated to high-performance, standalone UI
  components.
</p>
<p class="home-paragraph">
  InzForge is not a traditional component library delivered via NPM. Instead, it is a Blueprint Registry (inspired by
  Shadcn/UI) where components are distributed as raw source code. This approach ensures maximum portability,
  zero-dependency bloat, and full developer ownership.

  From the sidebar select the component you want to discover and you will have access to the source code ready for
  usage
