# InzForge UI
**A Source-First, Multi-Framework Blueprint Registry**

Welcome to InzForge, a personal engineering lab and component registry dedicated to high-performance, standalone UI components.

InzForge is not a traditional component library delivered via NPM. Instead, it is a Blueprint Registry (inspired by Shadcn/UI) where components are distributed as raw source code. This approach ensures maximum portability, zero-dependency bloat, and full developer ownership.

## Vision
The goal of InzForge is to bridge the gap between high-end design and modern frontend engineering. Every component is built twice—once for Angular and once for Vue—to master the nuances of state management, reactivity, and cross-browser stability.

- **Source-First:** Copy the code, own the logic, customize everything.
- **Modern Reactivity:** Built with Angular 18+ (Signals) and Vue 3 (Composition API).
- **Standalone Architecture:** Every component is an isolated unit, ready to be integrated into any project.
- **Engineering Excellence:** Dual-layer testing with Cypress and Playwright ensures production-grade reliability.

## Technical Stack
*   **Monorepo:** Nx
*   **Framework A:** Angular 18+ (Standalone Components, Signals)
*   **Framework B:** Vue 3 (Vite, script setup, Composition API)
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS (with centralized Design Tokens)
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Cypress:** Component Testing (Local/Interactive)
    *   **Playwright:** E2E Cross-browser Testing (Safari, Firefox, Chrome)

## Repository Structure
InzForge follows a modular "One Library per Component" strategy:

```text
inzforge/
├── apps/
│   ├── angular-inzforge      # Angular Showcase Gallery
│   └── vue-inzforge          # Vue Showcase Gallery
├── libs/
│   ├── shared/utils          # Shared logic (Tailwind merge, etc.)
│   ├── angular/ui/           # Isolated Angular Blueprints
│   │   └── button/           # Self-contained button library
│   └── vue/ui/               # Isolated Vue Blueprints
│       └── button/           # Self-contained button library
├── tailwind.config.base.js    # Centralized Design Tokens
└── PROJECT_CONTEXT.md        # AI-Agent Engineering Rules
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeinz/inzforge.git
cd inzforge
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Showcases
To see the components in action:
```bash
# Start Angular Showcase
npx nx serve angular-inzforge

# Start Vue Showcase
npx nx serve vue-inzforge
```

---

## Testing Strategy
InzForge maintains a strict testing mandate for every component.

**Cypress (Component Testing):**
```bash
npx nx component-test [component-name]
```

**Playwright (E2E Cross-browser):**
```bash
npx nx e2e [showcase-app-name]
```

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] Initialize Workspace and Shared Utils
- [ ] inz-button (Angular and Vue)
- [ ] inz-input (Angular and Vue)
- [ ] inz-card (Angular and Vue)
- [ ] Experimental CLI for source-code injection
