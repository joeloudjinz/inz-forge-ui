**A Source-First, Multi-Framework Blueprint Registry**

Welcome to InzForge, a personal engineering lab and component registry dedicated to high-performance, standalone UI components. it is a Blueprint Registry (inspired by Shadcn/UI) where components are distributed as raw source code.

## Available Libraries

The InzForge UI project is organized as a monorepo with libraries for different frameworks and shared utilities. Below is a list of the existing libraries:

### Shared Libraries

- **utils** (`libs/shared/utils`) - Contains shared utilities including the centralized `theme.css` file for Tailwind design tokens and global utility functions. This is the single source of truth for styling across all components. [Read more about it.](./libs/shared/utils/README.md)

### Angular Libraries

- **hyperui** (`libs/angular/hyperui`) - A collection of Angular components based on the HyperUI design system. [Read more about it.](./libs/angular/hyperui/README.md)

  - **accordion** (`libs/angular/hyperui/accordion`) - An Angular implementation of the HyperUI accordion component with multiple styles and configurations. Features include multiple accordion modes (Simple, Divided, Compact), dark mode support, RTL support, keyboard navigation, and accessibility support. [Read more about it.](./libs/angular/hyperui/accordion/README.md)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeinz/inz-forge-ui.git
cd inz-forge-ui
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Showcases

To see the components in action:

```bash
# Start Angular Showcase
npx nx serve angular-inzforge

# Start Vue Showcase
npx nx serve vue-inzforge
```

---

## Testing Strategy

InzForge maintains a strict testing mandate for every component.

**Cypress (Component Testing):**

```bash
npx nx component-test [component-name]
```

**Playwright (E2E Cross-browser):**

```bash
npx nx e2e [showcase-app-name]
```
